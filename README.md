### Description

This is a basic module that uses the File Date API. It includes these functions.

GetFileCreatedDate(filename as string) As Date

GetFileAccessDate(filename as string) As Date

GetFileModifyDate(filename as string) As Date

SetFileDates(filename as string,creation date as date.......) as boolean

I also included a little GUI that will let you select a file and change the date information, as an example on how to use the functions. Hope this helps someone.
